step 1:
Create HTML Templates:
Create templates for home, product listing, product detail, cart, and checkout pages.
  step 2: 
  Setting Up the Environment
Install Python:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Set Up a Virtual Environment:
  {
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  }
Install Required Packages:

For Flask:
{
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate Flask-Login
  }

Step 3: Backend Development
Create a New Project:

For Flask:
{
mkdir my_ecommerce
cd my_ecommerce
touch app.py
  }
Here I have taken only one product for my convenience we can take as many we want,but we want to change code in python backened(app.py) based on our products. 
These are just steps for creating and installing.
This is just basic level of creation of E Commerce website.
